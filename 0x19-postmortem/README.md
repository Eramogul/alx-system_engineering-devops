# Postmortem: Web Application Downtime Due to Database Overload  

## Issue Summary  
- **Duration:** March 5, 2025, 14:00 - 15:00 UTC  
- **Impact:** 70% of users experienced slow load times or full downtime on the web application.  
- **Root Cause:** A sudden surge in traffic caused an overload on the database, leading to a crash.  

## Timeline  
- **14:00 UTC:** Monitoring system detected high latency on database queries.  
- **14:05 UTC:** Users reported slow load times via support tickets.  
- **14:10 UTC:** Engineers investigated and found high CPU usage on the database server.  
- **14:20 UTC:** Restarted the database, but the issue persisted.  
- **14:30 UTC:** Scaled up the database instance to handle more connections.  
- **14:50 UTC:** Database performance improved, and services were restored.  
- **15:00 UTC:** Full resolution confirmed, and monitoring returned to normal.  

## Root Cause and Resolution  
- The primary cause was **a lack of connection pooling**, which led to too many open database connections.  
- Resolution: Implemented **connection pooling** and **autoscaling** for the database.  

## Corrective and Preventative Measures  
- **Enable database connection pooling** to prevent excessive open connections.  
- **Set up autoscaling** to dynamically adjust resources based on traffic.  
- **Improve monitoring** by adding alerts for high CPU and connection usage.  
- **Conduct load testing** to simulate traffic spikes and ensure stability.  

## Conclusion  
This outage was caused by unexpected traffic spikes overwhelming the database. By implementing **connection pooling and autoscaling**, we have reduced the risk of similar incidents in the future.
